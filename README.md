i'm a student and software engineer who is passionate about using technology to help solve real world problems in my community. i love to design and create technology to uplift the community. 
i enjoy working with frontend technologies like React, Angular, Javascript. I also enjoy python and java. in 2020, i published my very first application on to the app store and was endorsed by the one
and only Karlie Kloss. i'm also heavily involved with the local animal shelter and strive to better animal welfare. i have linked a machine learning model i created to help dogs at the shelter! i hope
you enjoy.
